# Linux file system

In Linux, everything is a file, or at least can be treated like one. It is important to know how to navigate the file system effectively and interact with files.

## Navigation
1. create the following directory structure here: this/is/a/directory
  - what are the commands you used?
  - read the mkdir man page to find out which switch to use to create those directories in one command
  - change into the new directory. note the command you use here
1. type "cd -"
  - What did that do?
1. type "cd ~"
  - What did that do?
  - go back to the directory containing this file. note the command you use.
1. copy the output of the command "history" below.
  - what are the numbers before the commands?
  - what happens when you use the command "!<number>" ?
  - if you ended up away from this directory, get back to the one containing this file
1. ls
  - what switch do you use for the long listing
  - what do the columns mean?
  - how to sort by date ascending / descending
